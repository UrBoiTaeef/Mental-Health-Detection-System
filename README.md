# 🧠 Mental Health Text Classifier: Detecting Anxiety & Depression using NLP

This project is a machine learning-based web application that uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to detect whether a piece of text reflects signs of **anxiety or depression**. Users input text describing their emotional state, and the system classifies it, offers a confidence score, mental health tips, and support information—all through a simple web interface.
